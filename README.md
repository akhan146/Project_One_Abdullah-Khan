## Problem Statement
Weak passwords are a significant cybersecurity risk. Many users choose short, predictable, or commonly used passwords that attackers can easily guess through brute-force attacks or pattern analysis.

This project solves that issue by providing a professional-grade password utility library capable of:
- Validating password structure  
- Checking character types  
- Calculating estimated entropy  
- Detecting repeated patterns  
- Identifying common/weak passwords  
- Generating strong random passwords  
- Providing full evaluation summaries
